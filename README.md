## Purpose

Users can effortlessly find, like, view details, and add their favorite images to a list with a single click.

## About the Project

Users encounter a homepage displaying sections about us, resources, and contact. To find a picture, they press the "TRY" button, leading to a new page. Here, they can search for their desired image and discover unique, high-resolution visuals. If they don't like the listed results, the "Show More" button provides access to additional images. If users find photos they fancy in the listing, they can add them to their favorite lists by hitting the like button. Clicking the eye icon provides detailed information and the source of the photo. Users have the flexibility to delete photos or clear their favorite lists as they wish. Explore the world of images with Thamzy!
